#Hello My First Blog
After deciding to build and maintain a new blog for myself, I spent two nights exploring and learning [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). And finally, here's my personal blog site going live. Also, creadit to [Gatsby Center Team](https://github.com/GatsbyCentral) for his fantastic [starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-v2-starter-lumen/). It's really helpful to avoid reinventing the wheels.
