My name is Chao Xu. 

I was born in Zhejiang China, finished my master degree in California, and got my first job at Amaozn Seattle HQ as a software engineer. 

Currently I am employed by Microsoft at the beautiful Vancouver. And due to the massive amount of decent restaurant here, it's hard for me to focus on writing blogs. I'll try my best to write as many as I can :-)
